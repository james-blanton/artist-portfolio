This portfolio was originally created for personal use only.
I later decided that I wished to make the code publically distributable and
relatively usable for someone who had very little experience with writing code for the web.

I am a novice programmer, so this portfolio package is not without flaws.

Here are some currentlty known issues in the code:

- Some notes need to be added to login, forgot_pass, & reset_password.

- The password reset email is sort of ugly. The first url won't display correctly in a email.
