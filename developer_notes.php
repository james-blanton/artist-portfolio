This portfolio was originally created for personal use only.
I later decided that I wished to make the code publically distributable and
relatively usable for someone who had very little experience with writing code for the web.

I am a novice programmer, so this portfolio package is not without flaws.

Here are some currentlty known issues in the code:

- Some notes need to be added to the forgot_pass.php and login.php file though.
- On edit_contact.php the admin needs to be able to edit their security question and answer.
