This portfolio was originally created for personal use only.
I later decided that I wished to make the code publically distributable and
relatively usable for someone who had very little experience with writing code for the web.

I am a novice programmer, so this portfolio package is not without flaws.

Here are some currentlty known issues in the code:

- Some notes need to be added to the forgot_pass.php, login.php files.

- Give the ability to change the existing password to something of their choosing.
